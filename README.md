git workflow
(first time setup) pull the repository git clone https://github.com/dryu99/infinite-animal-crossing-lofi.git
checkout into a new branch git checkout -b NAME-OF-BRANCH
make your changes, go wild!
tell git to track your changes by doing git add .
save your changes and give it a meaningful name by doing git commit -m "describe your changes here"
double check to see what git is keeping track of by doing git status
push those changes up to github git push origin NAME-OF-BRANCH
go to github and make a pull request!
merge it into master
common pitfalls
help! what do i do if my git says "failed to push some refs to origin"
you wanna pull your changes and do git pull origin master
help! i wanna revert to an earlier version!
find the last time you saved your work by doing git log and keep track of the hash
then git reset --hard <hash>
how do i update my local version to be up to date with github?
git pull origin master
how do i switch branches?
git checkout NAME-OF-BRANCH
  
  revert 
do <hash> --__ HEAD
